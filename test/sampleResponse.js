  "note": "Panurgic comes from a combination of two Greek words: pan-, meaning 'all,' and ergos, meaning 'work.' It's a rare word, but rarer still is the noun form panurgy, meaning 'skill in all kinds of work or business; craft.' Both are related to a variety of Latin classifications of bees, such as Panurgus, a genus, which connects panurgic to the idiomatic expression 'as busy as a bee.' John Morley, used it when writing in 1886 about Jean-Jacques Rousseau's perceptions of other philosophers.",
